## Project Title

Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Assignment Five was to add functionality to the provided HTML and CSS files. By creating some Div containers to represent each hour of the work day and creating logic for users to add tasks or goals to each individual hour of their work day. This project used DAYJS to add the date and to check what hour of the day it is to show the user what hour they are currently in. When the user adds a task or goal and clicks the 'Save' icon the data is stored in Local Storage. I am working to add the ability for the user to double click the same icon to remove the task or goal as well.
